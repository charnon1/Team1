###Week 1 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: Robot Moving in Straight Line and Arrange with team our milestones for the weeks ahead
- [ ] ~~Jacob, Charnon- Code to make  robot move in a straight line.~~ Familiarised with Nano and RPi instead
- [ ] Cong Fang- Help with AVC Plan
- [ ] Brady-Put together default robot Chassis
- [ ] Philip- Finish AVC plan


####Week 1 Review
* Goals set
* Software - little progress made in week 1, but familiarised with github, nano, rpi, etc.
* Hardware - build up the default chassis and made sure it was functioning properly
* Networking - Obtained the pi ip address and sorted out how to ssh into pi to use wirelessly

Comparison to objective: Slightly behind schedule, but this was due to the team needing to familiarise with the whole scope of the project. This was very worthwhile as now each member knows exactly what to do and progress can continue

###Week 2 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: Sensors interacting with motors, and Gate Connection
- [ ] Jacob and Brandon- Code to get a value from camera to know where the line is in the picture
- [ ] Charnon-Write code to control Motors using the value from the camera input
- [ ] Cong Fang-Learn how to connect to the PI wirelessly and if time start on communication with the gate
- [ ] Brady-Concept Chassis and finalise design.
- [ ] Philip-Help with Chassis design and check progress of group

####Week 2 Review
* Brandon added to team
* Software - uploaded test code to github. Familiarised with SSH.
* Hardware - Decided to change to tracks and prepared the required parts for this
* Network - sorted out the code needed to communicate with the server to open the gate.

Comparison to objective: Still slighly behind schedule, but making good progress. The sensors and motors both work, but only individually and still need to be linked with a PID controller.

###Week 3 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: Quadrant 1 and 2
- [ ] Jacob,Brandon and Charnon- Test robot, check it follows a line, fix if needed. Start on quadrant 3 intersections.
- [ ] Cong Fang-Code to communicate and open the gate
- [ ] Brady-3D print chassis, help with any debugging and check  all electronic components are working.
- [ ] Philip-3D Print Chassis, and check progress of group.

####Week 3 Review
* Software - base code added to, input from camera implemented into code to generate a proportional response, quadrant 1 almost completed
* Hardware - implemented the tracks into the chassis. was tested with some software to be functioning properly and can turn/move properly
* Network - stand alone code can communicate with the gate server and open the gate

Comparison to set objective: Still behind in schedule, but progress has significantly picked up from previous weeks. Need to shift quadrant 2 back a week and likely looking to focus on only getting up to quadrant 3 by the end.

###Week 4 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: ~~Quadrant 3 and 4~~ Finish quadrant 1 & 2
- [ ] Jacob,Brandon and Charnon- Finalise code for ~~quadrant 3 and help with quadrant 4.~~ quadrant 1 & 2
- [ ] Cong Fang- ~~Start on code for quadrant 4 detecting walls~~ Helping with quadrant 1 & 2
- [ ] Brady- ~~Help build final robot and test electronic components are all working~~ Updating all documentation and progress. Helping with the design of the 3D printed chassis
- [ ] Philip- ~~Put together Finalised robot Chassis, and help with debugging.~~ Designing the 3D printed chassis

####Week 4 Review
* Software - Camera detects the white line and displays a number depending on its position relative to the white line.
* Hardware - The 3d printed chassis design has been finalised and will be ready to be printed next week
* Network - Already completed.

Comparison to objective: Really behind in schedule. Additional time slot needs to be arranged for more progress. All members may need to be moved to software where significantly more progress is needed.

###Week 5 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: Testing and fixing, final run.
- [ ] All -Test robot
- [ ] Jacob, Brandon, Charnon and Cong Fang- Fix code if needed
- [ ] Brady and Philip-Test electronic components if needed.

###Week 6 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: AVC report.
- [ ] All-Start on Final Report

###Week 7 Checklist
- [ ] Overall goals: AVC report.
- [ ] All - finish final report

###Weekly Progress Checklist
- [ ] How has each team member performed against their goal set last week?
- [ ] Have you set a goal for each team member for this/next week?
- [ ] Has the team discussed which tasks are the most important or urgent?
- [ ] Do any team members need more help to complete their assigned task(s)?
- [ ] Have you updated the task list on Github this week?
- [ ] Are all relevant code, bot photos and design files on the team Github?
- [ ] Have you noted which members attended labs and team meetings?
